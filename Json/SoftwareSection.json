      "Worldly: Geography Made Fun": {
        "Project Overview": "<strong>Worldly</strong> is a fullstack multiplayer mobile game that I designed, built, and shipped as a solo project. It is built on a simple idea: make geography engaging, social, and easy to retain.<br /><br />With a friendly mascot named <strong>Yoram</strong>, and realtime multiplayer gameplay, Worldly turns geography into an interactive experience that encourages both competition and learning."
      },
      "Problem": "Geographic illiteracy is more widespread than many realize.<br /><br /><ul><li>Only 17% of young Americans can locate Afghanistan on a map.</li><li>88% cannot name a single country in Africa.</li><li>60% of adults believe Africa is a country.</li></ul><br />This lack of knowledge represents a disconnection from global awareness. Geography is a critical entry point into understanding <strong>history, culture, conflict, climate, and connection</strong>. We can't aspire to visit or empathize with places we've never even heard of.",
      "My Solution": "I built a game.<br /><br /><strong>Worldly</strong> is a mobile app that gamifies geography education using real-time multiplayer challenges and module based learning. It was designed to make global learning accessible, competitive, and fun.",
      "Target Personas": "Worldly was designed for:<br /><ul><li><strong>Curious learners</strong> of all ages who enjoy geography and visual games</li><li><strong>Parents and educators</strong> looking for alternatives to bland memorization methods</li><li><strong>Casual gamers</strong> who prefer low-friction mobile experiences with some educational value</li></ul>",
      "Key Features": "<ul><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong>: Face off with others in real-time map challenges</li><li><strong>Learning Modules</strong>: Unlock structured continent-based lessons</li><li><strong>Mascot Design</strong>: <em>Yoram</em> is a child-friendly guide who walks players through each challenge</li><li><strong>Audio Feedback</strong>: Reinforces right/wrong answers for better memory and engagement</li><li><strong>Color Psychology</strong>: The green interface was chosen deliberately. Green is linked to nature, peace, and balance. Research shows it improves focus, reduces stress, and enhances creative thinking, perfect for a geography themed learning environment.</li></ul>",
      "Color Palette": ["#74A651", "#97BF7A", "#F2B05E", "#FCC257", "#DEDEDE"],
      "Iterative Design": "After the initial beta release, I shared a Google Form with early users and gathered detailed feedback from over 30 testers. Common themes included:<br /><ul><li>A desire for more guided and structured learning</li><li>Requests for sound effects and clearer visual cues</li><li>Confusion about game flow in early rounds</li></ul><br />This led to several improvements:<br /><ul><li>Added <strong>audio cues</strong> for interaction and feedback</li><li>Improved onboarding and UI flow</li><li>Introduced <strong>progress tracking</strong> and <strong>unlockable learning paths</strong></li><li>Balanced the challenge system across skill levels</li></ul>",

I am learning countries I didn not even know existed.”</blockquote>",
      "Why It Matters": "Geography is the foundation of understanding our world. From migration patterns to international relations, learning about the planet we live on fosters empathy and global consciousness.<br /><br />With Worldly, players are connecting the dots between knowledge and curiosity."

      "Weather Now: Weather at a Glance": {
        "Project Overview": "Weather Now is a sleek and dynamic weather app co-created with developer Angelica Ibarlucea. Designed as both a functional weather tool and a stylish screensaver, it delivers real-time local weather, time, lunar phase, and sunset (Shkia) information for planning, religious observance, or ambiance. Built using React and JSON data structures, the app features a tropical, glassmorphism-inspired UI that transitions between light and dark themes automatically based on local time."
      },
      "Problem": "Weather apps can be cluttered, bland, or overloaded with utility features. I wanted a beautiful, full-screen app that functions as a desktop or TV screensaver, with clear weather and Shkia times for observant users, without sacrificing visual appeal or simplicity.",
      "My Solution": "We built a minimalistic, responsive React app that fetches real-time local weather and astronomical data. By using glassmorphism and tropical color themes, the interface becomes not only useful but also visually captivating. Sunset and lunar cycle info were added for deeper daily planning and spiritual awareness.",
      "Target Personas": "<ul><li>Observant individuals needing clear sunset/Shkia times for religious practices.</li><li>Designers and creatives who want a beautiful desktop experience.</li><li>Photographers or event planners needing quick access to weather and light info.</li><li>Casual users looking for ambient displays with real-time utility.</li></ul>",
      "Key Features": "<ul><li>Real-time weather data via API</li><li>Automatic theme switching (light/dark) based on local time</li><li>Shkia (sunset) and lunar phase data for planning and religious observance</li><li>Full-screen UI optimized for TV and desktop screensavers</li><li>Glassmorphism UI with vibrant tropical colors</li><li>Built with React and local JSON fallback support</li></ul>",
      "Color Palette": ["#355770", "#F27507", "#F2935C", "#F27A5E", "#F25E5E"],
      "Iterative Design": "The project began with a basic layout in Figma and went through multiple feedback cycles focused on simplifying visual noise, enhancing readability from a distance, and optimizing data placement. We fine-tuned contrast for both light and dark modes, adjusted spacing, and added lunar cycle support based on user suggestions.",
      "Results": "We successfully built and published this aesthetic, weather-at-a-glance display—and I use it on my TV all the time. Friends have shared that they love how the UI slowly fades into dark mode in the evening, creating a calm and ambient vibe.",
      "Why It Matters": "Weather Now bridges utility and aestetic, something sometimes overlooked in productivity tools. By respecting both functional and spiritual needs (like Shkia times), it demonstrates how UX can serve deeply personal contexts while still being elegant and modern. It reflects our belief that design should be both beautiful and meaningful."

      },
      "Problem": "Most existing Jewish Zmanim websites were built in the early 2000s. They're visually outdated and often confusing, with cluttered layouts and overlapping zmanim terminology that make it hard for users to know when Shabbat begins, when candle lighting is, or when certain prayers apply.",
      "My Solution": "I created a clean, one-pager mobile and web app with original digital art and a focus on simplicity. The app uses real-time geolocation and several APIs to give users accurate, beautifully presented zmanim and moon phase data. I also built a Hebrew-to-Gregorian calendar algorithm to handle lunar-solar conversions in JavaScript.",
      "Target Personas": "<ul><li>Observant individuals needing clear sunset/Shkia times for religious practices</li><li>Designers and creatives who want a beautiful, ambient screen experience</li><li>People exploring Jewish identity and looking for spiritual tech tools</li><li>Casual users curious about moon phases and celestial rhythms</li></ul>",
      "Key Features": "<ul><li>Real-time zmanim based on user geolocation</li><li>Beautiful, Shabbat-themed color palette inspired by royalty and calm</li><li>Original digital art and sprites created in Adobe Illustrator</li><li>One-page fullscreen UI, optimized for both phones and TV screens</li><li>Custom-built algorithm to convert Gregorian dates into Hebrew calendar equivalents</li></ul>",
      "Color Palette": ["#1E0A26", "#741B8C", "#9704BF", "#F2D8F2", "#FBF9F0"],
      "Iterative Design": "While building the lunar-solar calendar algorithm, I encountered several complexities around leap years, intercalated months, and fixed date anchors between the Hebrew and Gregorian systems. This led to many revisions and testing cycles. I also iterated on the UI after testing it on different screen types (TV, mobile, tablet) to make sure it felt peaceful and legible in all environments.",
      "Results": "I successfully built and shipped this aesthetic utility tool. It's Jewish tech that feels deeply personal to me, helping mark sacred time in a way that feels modern, clear, and intentional. Friends have shared that they appreciate how simple and beautiful it is.",
      "Why It Matters": "This project is a personal expression of Jewish identity through tech. It bridges ancient tradition and modern design, offering users a mindful way to track sacred time. By creating something beautiful and useful, it encourages spiritual curiosity and makes observance easier and more accessible."
