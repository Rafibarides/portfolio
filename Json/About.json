    "bio": "I am a passionate software developer, photographer, artist, and music producer with a lifelong obsession: transformation. Whether through music, art, video, or code, I’ve always been driven by the thrill of turning raw ideas into reality. I love creating new things that didn’t exist before. To me, these seemingly separate fields all share a common thread: starting from nothing and building something entirely new.\n\nThis creative drive has taken shape across industries. I’ve worked alongside artists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to craft digital assets featured in magazines, on highway billboards, and as part of marketing campaigns that helped sell out arenas and theaters including MSG, The Ritz, Ford Amphitheater, Hard Rock, and even Broadway stages.\n\nIn 2021, I self-published my debut album Papertown, followed by Kindly and Concrete Jungle. I've also been fortunate to help other artists bring their work into the world—handling everything from music production and songwriting to visual branding and graphic design.\n\nThough I first tinkered with HTML as a kid, I formally trained at the Marcy Lab School, completing over 2,000 hours of intensive study in product development, UI/UX design, and computer science fundamentals. There, I developed fluency in JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL, Postgres, and more. Since then, I’ve shipped two apps to the App Store, including a full-stack, multiplayer geography game.\n\nOutside of work, I live in Brooklyn, explore amateur astrophysics in my spare time, and find grounding in philosophical inquiry. I'm excited to see how the next chapter unfolds—and what new forms of transformation it might hold."
