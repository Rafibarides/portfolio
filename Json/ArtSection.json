    "text": "This was made by tearing pages from books written across different time periods, each with its own tone, texture, and decay. The older the book, the more stained and worn the paper was. I was inspired by the aging of the paper and the aging became the palette.\n\nI cut and arranged these fragments by hand, layering them to form a face on canvas. What emerged is a reflection of how identity is built from layered stories, history, and thought. Time itself became the medium, each scrap from another era, now woven into something entirely new."
